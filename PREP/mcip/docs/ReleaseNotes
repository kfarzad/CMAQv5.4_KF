********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 5.4 (12 September 2022)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code's version number is updated to version 5.4. With this release,
no changes have been made to the MCIP code.  

As implemented with the release of the previous version (v5.3.3), the version 
numbering for MCIP is kept consistent with CMAQ to minimize confusion within the 
user community. Therefore, MCIP's version is updated to v5.4 for consistency.  

MCIPv5.4 accompanies CMAQv5.4.  If you are using CMAQv5.3+, you must
upgrade to use MCIPv5.0+.

MCIPv5.4 requires I/O API version 3.1 or greater to support error-checking
within the I/O API.

MCIPv5.4 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

A DOI will also be available for CMAQv5.4 (which includes MCIPv5.4).
